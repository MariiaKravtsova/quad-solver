## Programming standards

C99 is used as a coding standard. Please refer to [coding standards EECS 381](http://umich.edu/~eecs381/handouts/C_Coding_Standards.pdf)

This needs to be ran on linux using gcc -wall -pedantic.

For our coding standard we are going to use C99 that has IEEE 754 floating point support.
