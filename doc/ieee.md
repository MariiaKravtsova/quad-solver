## IEEE Floating point

Since our coding standard is C99, it has IEEE 754 floating point support.

A major feature of C99 is its numerics support, and in particular its support for access to the
features of IEEE 754-1985 (also known as IEC 60559) floating point hardware present in the vast
majority of modern processors (defined in "Annex F IEC 60559 floating-point arithmetic").
Platforms without IEEE 754 hardware can also implement it in software
