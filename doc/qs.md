## Quadratic solver

Quadratic equation is any equation having the form ax^2+bx+c=0
where x represents an unknown, and a, b, and c represent known numbers such that a is not equal to 0.

The quadratic solver uses the quadratic formula presented below to solve the quadratic equation at hand.

From the programming stand point it is an interesting challenge because of it's complex cases like negative numbers, undefined
or infinite solutions. And of course the limitations of the computer to compute the floating point because of the rounding error.
