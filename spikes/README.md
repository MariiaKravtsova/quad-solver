# Spikes

Spikes are examples of code that we wrote to learn how things work, and test how
the code will behave if we add it to our implementation.

In the process of figuring out and building the quad solver, here are some of the things we have spiked:

* Makefiles
* IEEE floating points
* small quad solver equations
* parsing user input and user output
* CUnit
* Mock Objects
