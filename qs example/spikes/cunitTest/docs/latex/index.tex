\subsection*{Introduction}

This is a simple test example showing basic unit testing in C.

This project also uses basic Doxygen formating to generate comments, man files, and etc.

\subsection*{C\+Unit Compilation Notes}

When builing the test unit, there was an issue linking the C\+Unit header files to \hyperlink{t__lib_8c}{t\+\_\+lib.\+c} file. The switch {\bfseries -\/lcunit} was used, however the location of the switch was wrong. The {\bfseries -\/lcunit} switch M\+U\+S\+T preceed the src files in the compile command.

Example\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}gcc -lcunit t_lib.c lib.c -o test.out
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Makefile Notes}

A make file is used to build, execute, run test, and generate Doxygen files.

Make commands\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}make:       Builds the executable adder.out
run:        Runs adder.out
makeTest:   Builds the executable t_lib.out
runTest:    Runs t_lib.out
docs:       Generates Doxygen documentation
viewDocs:   View the generated documentation in Firefox
clean:      Removes contents of builds and deletes the docs file
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Doxygen Notes}

Doxyfile Settings Changed\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}PROJECT_NAME = "NameChangeHere"
PROJECT_NUMBER = #.#
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY  = ./docs
PTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C = YES
EXTRACT_ALL = YES
EXTRACT_PRIVATE = YES
EXTRACT_STATIC = YES
INPUT = ./ ./src
SOURCE_BROWSER = YES
GENERATE_MAN = YES
\end{DoxyVerb}
